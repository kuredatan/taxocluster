- Info.csv: metadata for the samples
- FASTA file: identify the sequences of the taxonomic tree
- match folder: contains the reads and the nodes matching these reads for each patient (one patient = one file), and the .test files
- Some distance matrices for each of the distances

/!\ Some nodes are in the tree but not in the data matrix!
